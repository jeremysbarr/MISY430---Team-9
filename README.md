iCloset App

This mobile application syncs with your deviceâ€™s location/weather and clock modules in order to display potential outfit choices. Upon installation, the user answers a series of questions, including age and gender. The user will have the option to select the attire type, which would directly influence the outfit options that are shown. The user can swipe through displayed outfits, and will have the option to add a specific outfit to "My Closet", which is where the user can access any saved outfits for future reference. Lastly, the user can tap on an article of clothing displayed among the options, which will link them to a website where they can then purchase that item.
